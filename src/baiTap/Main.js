The tip of the nose was dark brown, like a chocolate bar. Large nostrils, wheezing when hot. The hair around the mouth is white, like long beside the beard, can have a man's taste! It likes to use sticky tongue licking our hands, that feeling wet, can be itchy! Its feet are plum shaped, long a thick layer of meat pad, sharp claws into the meat pad, start road not a sound.</Text>

                <Text style={{ fontSize: 15, color: '#000000', fontWeight: '400' }}>My family has a cute and clever dog, Mary.
                    It's fat, fat and lovely. Its yellow fur is very beautiful.
                    Mary's eyes were round like two topaz stones. Its legs are very long and it can run very fast. The tail, in particular, wagged to and fro when it saw me, as if to show affection to me.
                    The dog had a very strange appearance, with a flat nose, a wide mouth, swaying ears, and a wrinkled forehead, but in a very orderly way. Many bigger dogs are a little afraid of him and hide from him. In fact, it is disgusting and kind. Every time I take it to the park or climb a mountain, passers-by point at it.
                    I thought, perhaps it was thinking to itself: I am very ugly, but I am very gentle.</Text>
